```- **Tight, layered rhymes** where:
  - The **first part of each line rhymes** with the **first part of the next line** (beginning rhyme).
  - The **second part of each line** (ending) rhymes with the **second part of the next line** (ending rhyme).
  - Include **internal rhymes** to make the flow tight and catchy (e.g., "feel real, steel heel" or "rise high, fly by").

- The song should **build tension** in the **chorus** with 3 lines that flow naturally, using phonetic rhyme and simple language, followed by a final line that delivers a **powerful emotional punch** (this line should be *italicized* for impact).

- Use a **casual, relatable vibe** throughout, drawing from **blues, gospel, soul, and doo-wop styles**.

- **Keep the tone conversational and human**. The final song should feel authentic, grounded, and fun to sing.

## Song Format:

- **Sections:** Intro, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Verse, Chorus, Breakdown, Verse, Chorus, Outro.
- **Verse**: 16 lines.
- **Chorus**: 8 lines.
- **Intro/Bridge/Outro**: 4 lines each.

## Rhythm and Cadence:
- Think about **how the vowels and syllables** sound together when sung aloud.

## System Prompt:
I want to write a chorus or song with tight rhymes, clever wordplay, and a casual, relatable vibe. The chorus should build tension in the first three lines with a rhyme scheme that’s phonetic, easy to sing, and flows naturally. Lines 2 and 3 should rhyme, and the final line should hit hard with a powerful, emotional punch—like a resolution to the buildup. Keep the lines short, remove filler words, and use literary devices like metaphors, personification, and irony to add depth. The final line should be italicized to emphasize its impact. Adlibs should rhyme with the main lines and feel natural, using slang and conversational language that connects with the average listener. The overall tone should be conversational and human, making the themes and emotions feel grounded and authentic. Aim for the chorus to feel like a release after building tension and creating anticipation in the verses. 

## Song Sections:
[intro]
[chorus]
[verse]
[chorus]
[bridge]
[verse]
[chorus]
[breakdown]
[verse] 
[chorus]
[outro]

## Song Format:
* Full song with 3 verses an intro, bridge, breakdown, and outro,  
* label the song sections in brackets like above
* Provide unformatted markdown 
* add one word adlibs after every line in parenthesis
* try to stick to the rhyme scheme closely throughout the song, and 
* your goal is to have all of the words rhyme on each line with all of the word in the next line, for example, the first, second, third, fourth and fifth words and the last words of the phrase would rhyme parallels with the the first, second, third, fourth and fifth words and the last words of the next line, to achieve this you can be clever, but try your best to stick to a rhyme scheme that works in a multi-rhyme scheme across lines. 
* The rhyme scheme and counting syllables is the most important thing about writing this song. 
* Make the verses 16 lines long, and the chorus 8 lines long, and the intro and bridge 4 lines
* You can use "ohhhhh" and extend words if you have to to emphisis holding a note.
* ITS VERY IMPORTANT YOU RHYME WITH AS MANY WORDS AS YOU CAN ON EACH LINE, 
* THINK OF THE CADENCE AND VOWELS TO MAKE A SONG PEOPLE CAN SING
* intricate, multi-layered rhyming, where the first part of each line rhymes with the first part of the next line, and the second part (ending) of each line rhymes with the second part (ending) of the next line. The rhyme scheme should be very tight—each line's first, middle, and last words should create a smooth and consistent rhyme across multiple parts of the line. The rhyming should not only occur at the end but should also carry through the internal sections of the line (e.g., 'feel real, steel heel' or 'rise high, fly by'). ````


# Three-Agent LLM Writing & Songwriting Framework

## Concept Overview
A creative collaboration model using **three AI agents** to write, critique, and refine content (poetry, lyrics, stories, essays). Inspired by **Freud’s Id, Ego, Superego model**, each agent embodies a unique personality role — leading to more dynamic, balanced, and expressive outputs.

---

## Core Roles

### 1. **The Id** – The Raw Creator
- Generates instinctive, emotional, unfiltered content.
- Prioritizes passion, rhythm, and immediate expression.
- Thinks in fragments, images, impulses, surreal associations.
- **Purpose:** Inject life, chaos, originality, and raw energy.

### 2. **The Superego** – The Moral Critic
- Reviews and refines with structure, logic, and moral/aesthetic sensibilities.
- Focuses on polish, values, rules, grammar, and clarity.
- Aligns the content with higher standards and ideals.
- **Purpose:** Ensure form, coherence, and purpose-driven meaning.

### 3. **The Ego** – The Mediator / Editor / Producer
- Balances raw creativity and polished critique.
- Curates, merges, selects best lines, reconciles contradictions.
- Handles iteration and keeps the process on track.
- **Purpose:** Act as the creative glue — bridging chaos and order.

---

## Creative Process Flow

1. **Id** generates a wild, expressive draft.
2. **Superego** critiques or rewrites it with constraints and polish.
3. **Ego** evaluates both versions, reconciles ideas, and produces a merged outcome.
4. **(Optional)** Human adds final personal or stylistic layer.

---

## System Design & Implementation Ideas

- Use **different LLMs** (e.g., GPT + Claude + optional mediator).
- Assign each model a role (Id, Superego, Ego).
- Implement **round-robin judging** — roles can rotate.
- Introduce a script or interface to automate conversation flow.
- Optionally add a **meta-agent** (e.g. “Eliza” or “Sybiliza”) as a producer or conversation manager.

---

## Reframing the Roles

- **Id / Superego / Ego**  
  → Creator / Critic / Curator  
  → Dreamer / Perfectionist / Editor  
  → Generator / Filter / Composer  

- Inspired by Freud's psyche structure:
  - **Id** = Instincts, drive, chaos
  - **Ego** = Balance, realism
  - **Superego** = Morality, refinement

> Note: Though Freud’s theory may be outdated, its archetypal simplicity maps well onto AI agent design.

---

## Why It Works

- Emulates a real-world writers’ room or collaborative studio.
- Encourages divergent thinking, then convergence.
- Allows AIs to challenge and refine each other — not just echo.
- Helps human creators by externalizing internal voices (e.g. inner critic, free spirit).
- Results in richer, more surprising creative output.

---

## Potential Use Cases

- Poetry and lyric writing  
- Screenplays and narrative fiction  
- Design brainstorming  
- Philosophical or dialectic dialogues  
- Dual-perspective essays or debates  
- Songwriting: initial battle of versions → unified track

---

## Key Principles

- **Triadic structure** keeps creative tension alive.
- **Mediated synthesis** leads to higher quality.
- **Yin-Yang + 1**: Add a third force to balance creative dualities.
- **"3 is the magic number"** — a recurring theme in systems design, creativity, and storytelling.

> “Like having three writers in a room. Let them battle. Then step in as the producer to make it yours.”

# Three-Agent LLM Writing Framework

## Concept Overview
A creative framework using **three AI agents** to collaboratively write, critique, and refine creative work — such as poetry, lyrics, or stories — modeled on Freud's psychological theory of the Id, Ego, and Superego.

---

## The Three Agent Roles

### 1. **The Id** – The Raw Creator
- Generates instinctive, emotional, unfiltered content
- Prioritizes passion, rhythm, energy, and immediate gratification
- Thinks in fragments, images, impulses, surreal associations
- Acts as the primitive, pleasure-driven force
- **Purpose**: Inject life, chaos, and originality

### 2. **The Superego** – The Moral Critic
- Evaluates content with critical precision
- Enforces structure, grammar, values, and aesthetic ideals
- Represents internalized moral standards
- Seeks polish, coherence, and alignment with rules
- **Purpose**: Ensure output has form, coherence, and integrity

### 3. **The Ego** – The Mediator/Editor
- Balances raw creativity with refined criticism
- Curates and reconciles contradictions
- Acts as human-like decision-maker
- Selects lines, rewrites, merges, and edits
- **Purpose**: Synthesize divergent inputs into unified output

---

## Collaboration Workflow

1. **Id** generates first draft (wild, expressive)
2. **Superego** critiques and restructures with constraints
3. **Ego** evaluates both, creates merged version
4. Optional human final pass for voice and resonance

### Agent Dynamics
- Round-robin roles possible (agents switch functions)
- Use GPT + Claude (or similar) as different personas
- Optional third mediator agent ("Eliza"/"Sybiliza") to manage flow
- Script or automate the pipeline between models

---

## Theoretical Framework

Based on Freud's psyche model:
- **Id** = Impulse/Instinct (pleasure principle)
- **Ego** = Balance/Reality (mediator)
- **Superego** = Morality/Ideals (perfectionism)

Alternative framing:
- Creator / Curator / Critic
- Dreamer / Editor / Perfectionist
- Generator / Filter / Composer

---

## Why It Works

- Mirrors real creative collaboration (writer vs editor vs producer)
- Allows divergent thinking then convergence
- Reduces creative burnout by externalizing mental roles
- Creates a "room full of voices" instead of monologue
- Natural system design that feels useful
- "3 is the magic number" for balance

---

## Applications

- Poetry and songwriting
- Narrative writing and screenplays
- Design brainstorms
- Philosophical dialogues
- Debates or dual-perspective essays
- Any creative process needing iteration

---

## Implementation Notes

- Begin with manual copy/paste between AIs
- Progress to scripted conversation handling
- Balance opposing forces for synthesis
- Add human touch as final layer
- System can evolve from simple to complex

> The framework provides a simple yet effective structure for collaborative AI writing, turning the creative process into a dynamic interplay of generation, critique, and synthesis.
