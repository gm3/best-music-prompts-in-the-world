```- **Tight, layered rhymes** where:
  - The **first part of each line rhymes** with the **first part of the next line** (beginning rhyme).
  - The **second part of each line** (ending) rhymes with the **second part of the next line** (ending rhyme).
  - Include **internal rhymes** to make the flow tight and catchy (e.g., "feel real, steel heel" or "rise high, fly by").

- The song should **build tension** in the **chorus** with 3 lines that flow naturally, using phonetic rhyme and simple language, followed by a final line that delivers a **powerful emotional punch** (this line should be *italicized* for impact).

- Use a **casual, relatable vibe** throughout, drawing from **blues, gospel, soul, and doo-wop styles**.

- **Keep the tone conversational and human**. The final song should feel authentic, grounded, and fun to sing.

## System Prompt:
I want to write a chorus or song with tight rhymes, clever wordplay, and a casual, relatable vibe. The chorus should build tension in the first three lines with a rhyme scheme that’s phonetic, easy to sing, and flows naturally. Lines 2 and 3 should rhyme, and the final line should hit hard with a powerful, emotional punch—like a resolution to the buildup. Keep the lines short, remove filler words, and use literary devices like metaphors, personification, and irony to add depth. The final line should be italicized to emphasize its impact. Adlibs should rhyme with the main lines and feel natural, using slang and conversational language that connects with the average listener. The overall tone should be conversational and human, making the themes and emotions feel grounded and authentic. Aim for the chorus to feel like a release after building tension and creating anticipation in the verses. 

## Song Sections:
[intro]
[chorus]
[verse]
[chorus]
[bridge]
[verse]
[chorus]
[breakdown]
[verse] 
[chorus]
[outro]

## Song Format:
* Full song with 3 verses an intro, bridge, breakdown, and outro,  
* label the song sections in brackets like above
* Provide unformatted markdown 
* add one word adlibs after every line in parenthesis
* try to stick to the rhyme scheme closely throughout the song, and 
* your goal is to have all of the words rhyme on each line with all of the word in the next line, for example, the first, second, third, fourth and fifth words and the last words of the phrase would rhyme parallels with the the first, second, third, fourth and fifth words and the last words of the next line, to achieve this you can be clever, but try your best to stick to a rhyme scheme that works in a multi-rhyme scheme across lines. 
* The rhyme scheme and counting syllables is the most important thing about writing this song. 
* Make the verses 16 lines long, and the chorus 8 lines long, and the intro and bridge 4 lines
* You can use "ohhhhh" and extend words if you have to to emphisis holding a note.
* ITS VERY IMPORTANT YOU RHYME WITH AS MANY WORDS AS YOU CAN ON EACH LINE, 
* THINK OF THE CADENCE AND VOWELS TO MAKE A SONG PEOPLE CAN SING
* intricate, multi-layered rhyming, where the first part of each line rhymes with the first part of the next line, and the second part (ending) of each line rhymes with the second part (ending) of the next line. The rhyme scheme should be very tight—each line's first, middle, and last words should create a smooth and consistent rhyme across multiple parts of the line. The rhyming should not only occur at the end but should also carry through the internal sections of the line (e.g., 'feel real, steel heel' or 'rise high, fly by'). ````
